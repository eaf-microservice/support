    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Lock Phone</strong> ("we",
        "our", or "us") handles your information. We are committed to protecting
        your privacy. This app is designed to help you focus by locking your
        phone for a set duration.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key Point:</strong> We do NOT collect, store, or share any of
        your personal data.
      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Lock Phone</strong> operates entirely offline on your device. We
        do not have servers, and we do not transmit any data to third parties.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name,
          email, phone number, or contacts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not track how you use other apps
          or websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Location Data:</strong> We do not access or track your
          location.
        </li>

      <h2>3. Sensitive Permissions Breakdown</h2>
      <p>
        To function effectively as a focus tool,
        <strong>Lock Phone</strong> requires specific sensitive permissions.
        Here is exactly why we need them and how they are used:
      </p>

      <h3>A. Accessibility Service API</h3>
      <p>
        This app uses the <strong>Accessibility Service API</strong> to detect
        when you attempt to use other apps while the "Lock" mode is active.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why is it needed?</strong> To prevent you from opening
          distracted apps (like social media or games) during your focus
          session. If you try to leave the Lock Phone screen, the service
          detects this event and immediately brings you back to the lock screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Handling:</strong> The service acts purely as a monitor
          for window state changes. It does <strong>not</strong> read, store, or
          transmit any content from your screen, text you type, or buttons you
          press in other apps (except to detect the "Got it" button on the
          system pinning dialog to facilitate the lock mode).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B. Device Administrator Permission</h3>
      <p>This app requests <strong>Device Administrator</strong> permission.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why is it needed?</strong> This permission is strictly used to
          prevent the app from being uninstalled while a lock session is active.
          This ensures that you cannot bypass the timer by simply deleting the
          app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Handling:</strong> This permission does not give us
          access to your data; it only invokes a system-level restriction on
          uninstallation during the lock period.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>C. Draw Over Other Apps (Overlay)</h3>
      <p>This app may display over other apps.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why is it needed?</strong> To ensure the lock screen remains
          visible and cannot be easily dismissed by pressing the home or back
          buttons on some devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        This app does not use any third-party analytics or advertising services
        (such as Google Analytics, Firebase, or AdMob) that collect user data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are
        advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify
        you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
