      <h1 style="text-align: center">Privacy Policy for Simulateur Facture</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 06/11/2025</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for using Simulateur Facture (the "App"), provided by EAF
        microservice ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your
        privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is intended to be as simple and clear as possible to
        inform you about our data practices.
      </p>

      <div class="disclaimer">
        <p>
          <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> This is a general template and is
          <strong>not legal advice</strong>. You are responsible for ensuring
          this policy is accurate for your app and complies with all applicable
          laws (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and app store requirements. I strongly
          recommend having this policy reviewed by a legal professional before
          publishing it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Data Collection: We Collect Nothing</h2>

      <p>
        We believe in privacy. Our app is designed to be a simple, offline tool.
      </p>

      <h3>No Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any
        personal information. "Personal information" includes your name, email
        address, phone number, location, device identifiers, or any other data
        that could be used to identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>No Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> collect any information about how you use the
        app (analytics), what you calculate, or the data you enter (such as your
        water or electricity consumption figures).
      </p>

      <h3>Local Calculations</h3>
      <p>
        All calculations performed by the App happen exclusively on your device.
        The information you enter for your bill calculations never leaves your
        device and is not visible to us.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any data, we do not use any data for any
        purpose. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not use your data for advertising.</li>
        <li>We do not use your data for analytics.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or share your data with anyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The App <strong>does not</strong> use any third-party services that
        could collect information from you. This includes analytics services,
        advertising networks, or social media SDKs.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <strong>[Important Note:]</strong> If you use ads (like Google AdMob),
          you <strong>MUST</strong> change this section. Ad networks are third
          parties and they <em>do</em> collect data. You would need to disclose
          this and link to their privacy policies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App is not directed at children under the age of 17. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 17 (or the
        relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any
        personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently
        collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly address
        the issue.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on
        our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any changes.
      </p>
