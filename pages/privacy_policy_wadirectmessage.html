      <h1 style="text-align: center">Privacy Policy for Wa Direct Message</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 07/11/2025</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for using Wa Direct Message (the "App"), provided by EAF microservice
        ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy is intended to be as simple and clear as possible to
        inform you about our data practices.
      </p>

      <div class="disclaimer">
        <p>
          <strong>Legal Disclaimer:</strong> This is a general template and is
          <strong>not legal advice</strong>. You are responsible for ensuring
          this policy is accurate for your app and complies with all applicable
          laws (like GDPR, CCPA, etc.) and app store requirements. I strongly
          recommend having this policy reviewed by a legal professional before
          publishing it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>1. Information We Handle</h2>

      <p>
        Our app is designed with your privacy as a priority. To perform its
        function, the app needs to handle the phone number you wish to message.
      </p>

      <h3>Phone Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        When you enter a phone number to start a chat, the App handles this
        information temporarily on your device.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We <strong>do not</strong> save, store, or record the phone number in
          the App.
        </li>
        <li>
          We <strong>do not</strong> transmit the phone number to our servers.
          We don't have servers.
        </li>
        <li>
          We <strong>do not</strong> share the phone number with any third party
          other than the official WhatsApp application on your device.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>No Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        Other than the temporary handling of the phone number, we <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any
        personal information. "Personal information" includes your name, email
        address, location, device identifiers, or any other data
        that could be used to identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>No Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        We <strong>do not</strong> collect any information about how you use the
        app (analytics), what you send, or the data you enter (such as message
        or phone number).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any data, we do not use any data for any
        purpose. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not use your data for advertising.</li>
        <li>We do not use your data for analytics.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or share your data with anyone.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Interaction with WhatsApp</h2>
      <p>
        Our App's core function is to make it easier to start a conversation on
        WhatsApp.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The App takes the phone number you provide and uses the official
          WhatsApp service to open a chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          The App itself <strong>does not</strong> send the message or store
          your contacts. You are always in control of sending the message using
          the official WhatsApp application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are redirected to WhatsApp, your activity, communication, and
          data are governed by
          <strong
            ><a
              href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy"
              target="_blank"
              >WhatsApp's Privacy Policy</a
            ></strong
          >. We strongly encourage you to review their policy to understand how
          they handle your data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
        us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. If
        we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child
        under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps
        to remove that information.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on
        our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically for any changes.
      </p>
