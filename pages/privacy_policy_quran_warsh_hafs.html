        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the Quran Karim Offline application
            (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App is designed to be used offline and does not collect any personal information from you. All data is
            stored locally on your device.</p>
        <p>The App stores the following information on your device using the <code>shared_preferences</code> package:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Night Mode:</strong> Your preference for a dark or light theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Reading Mode:</strong> Your preferred reading mode (Warsh or Hafs).</li>
            <li><strong>Last Page:</strong> The last page you were reading to allow you to resume your reading.</li>
            <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> A list of pages you have bookmarked for future reference.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information is stored solely on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information stored on your device is used solely to enhance your experience with the App. We do not have
            access to this information.</p>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your information with any third parties. The App includes a "Share" feature that allows you
            to share a link to the App's page on the Google Play Store. This action is initiated by you, and no personal
            data is shared in the process.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored on your device. However, since the data is
            stored locally, the security of your device is your responsibility.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a
            parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please
            contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy in this section of the App.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
